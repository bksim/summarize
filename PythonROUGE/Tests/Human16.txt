The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that a deadly bacteria that is resistant to nearly all antibiotics, called Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), is becoming increasingly prevalent in hospitals across the US. During the first half of 2012, almost 200 hospitals and long-term acute care facilities treated at least 1 patient infected with CRE bacteria. Nearly half the patients who develop a bloodstream infection from CRE die. The bacteria is particularly problematic because it can transfer its resistant properties to other bacteria. CDC has launched an all-out campaign, a "detect and protect" strategy, urging hospitals and other health care facilities to act promptly to detect and contain CRE in patients.
