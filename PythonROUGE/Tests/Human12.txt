February durable goods orders increased 5.7% shrugging off some economists expectations of a more meager gain of 3.8% from the previously reported 4.9% drop in January.  Compared to the revised January durable goods drop of 3.8%, this push upwards signals somewhat higher demand overall in February for products intended for long-term use. Durable goods orders were positive in part thanks to a 21.7% increase in transportation equipment. This in turn was partially owed to American Airlines placing a 143 lot order with Boeing who gathered 179 aircraft orders in total for February dwarfing it's January figure of 2.  Automobile orders moved up 3.8% while defense aircraft orders increased by 7.6%. Durable goods sans transportation dropped .5% after a move up in January of 2.9% missing economist expectations of .5% higher.  Meanwhile core capital goods shipments (used for determining gross domestic product report equipment and software spending) increased 1.9% suggesting business spending will get a bump for Q1 afterall considering the .7% fall last month. Other economic indicators of productivity such as Industrial Production and the ISM's survey of national factory activity were also positive.
