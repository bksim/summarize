In France, the body of a 52-year-old female hiker who fell about 1,000 feet to her death was eaten by Griffon vultures in about 45 minutes. While searching for the woman's body in a helicopter, rescuers saw vultures in the area but were not aware they were eating the body. Rescuers said only the woman's bones and clothing remained. Local farmers have suffered significant livestock losses to Griffon vultures and the latest incident has fueled demands to seek permission to shoot the protected animals. Farmers claim the protections are making the vulture population too large.
