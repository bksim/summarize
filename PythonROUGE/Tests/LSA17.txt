Officials at Sugarloaf say search teams have found 17-year-old Nicholas Joy alive. Joy was found near the Caribou Pond Road, off the western side of Sugarloaf Mountain. Paul said he went on that trail knowing Joy was last seen on that side of the mountain. The Maine Warden Service says Joy, who is from Medford, Massachusetts, was found at approximately 9:00am on Tuesday. The Maine Warden Service, the Sugarloaf ski patrol and others had been searching for Joy on skis, snowshoes and snowmobiles since Sunday afternoon, when he was reported missing after failing to meet up with his father.
