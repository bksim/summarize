Once again, Business Insider founder Henry Blodget is getting a boost from Amazon. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon (AMZN, Fortune 500), led a group of investors in a $5 million funding of Blodget's financial blog Business Insider. Bezos' vote of confidence in Business Insider comes 15 years after Blodget, a stock analyst at the time, made a bold call on Amazon. Business Insider plans to use this latest round of capital "to invest aggressively in many areas of the business, including editorial, tech/product, sales and marketing, subscriptions, and events," as well as office expansion, Blodget said in his memo. Bezos and Blodget discussed a potential investment over dinner in 2012, and Blodget said Bezos "sees some parallels" between Amazon and Business Insider. In turn, Blodget wants Business Insider to mirror Amazon's "obsession with customers and long-term focus.
