Durable goods orders jumped 5.7% as demand for transportation equipment rebounded strongly, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The rise last month in durable goods orders, which range from toasters to aircraft, reversed Januaryâ€™s 3.8% plunge. Economists polled by Reuters had expected orders to rise 3.8% after a previously reported 4.9% fall in January. Excluding transportation, orders slipped 0.5% after increasing 2.9% in January. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 2.7%, the largest decline since July. Orders for the so-called core capital goods had jumped 6.7% in January and economists had expected a 1.2% drop last month. However, core capital goods shipments, used to calculate equipment and software spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.9%. Overall orders for durable goods were buoyed by a 21.7 % jump transportation equipment as demand for civilian aircraft surged 95.3%. Boeing received orders for 179 aircraft, up from only two in January, according to information posted on its website. They were boosted by American Airlines, which placed 143 orders, including 42 for the grounded 787 Dreamliners. Motor vehicle orders increased 3.8%. Defense aircraft orders rose 7.6%.
