Niagara County officials in western New York are facing a lawsuit from the parents of Roger Dunn, who allege that a coroner took a piece of his body for canine police-training after he died last year. His body was transported to the office of Niagara County Coroner Russell Jackman, but not before he provided some of Dunn's tissue to a volunteer firefighter chief Vincent Salerno, who was trying to train a dog to track human remains. Dunn's parents allege in the suit that tissue was taken from their son's body by the Cambria coroner and given to a volunteer firefighter chief to train a dog to sniff human remains. The Dunn's have filed their lawsuit, which does not specify damages, against the county coroner's office, the former coroner Jackman, the former firefighter chief Salerno and the volunteer fire department. They also had to write apology letters to Danny and Anita Dunn, the parents of Roger. The Dunns filed their lawsuit with Michael Dowd, an attorney from Lewiston, to the New York State Supreme Court against the coroner's office, Jackman, Salerno and the volunteer firefighter department.
