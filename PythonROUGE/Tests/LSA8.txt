Detailed within a recent ruling by a California court in Fresno, a judge ruled that the law banning wireless, cellular phone use while operating a motor vehicle also applies to California residents and visitors that attempt to use a mapping application like Google Maps while driving. While section 23123 of the California Vehicle Code was instituted primarily to ban voice calling and typing out text messages while driving a car, a man named Steven Spriggs challenged a citation for violating section 23123 during a traffic stop during January 2012. That distraction would be present whether the wireless telephone was being used as a telephone, a GPS navigator, a clock, or a device for sending and receiving text messages and e-mails.‚Äù Basically a very broad interpretation, any application that requires hands-on interaction while driving is illegal under section 21123 of the California Vehicle Code.
