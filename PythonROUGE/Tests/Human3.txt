A recent Swedish study published in the journal Pediatrics found that babies whose pacifiers were cleaned with their parents' mouth instead of water were less likely to develop an allergic disease such as eczema and asthma. Researchers say it's possible that parents who clean their baby's pacifiers with saliva transfer harmless mouth bacteria which may boost their child's bacterial diversity and foster immunity.
