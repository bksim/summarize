A law that was primarily enacted to ban drivers from texting and calling without a hands-free device has been broadly interpreted to include any use of a mobile phone with your hands while driving. A man named Steven Spriggs was cited for using his smartphone to get directions. He argued that the law was intended to only ban texting and talking but California Judge W. Kent Hamlin ruled against him. Judge Hamlin concluded that "the primary evil sought to be avoided is the distraction the driver faces when using his or her hands to operate the phone." Smartphones could still be used while driving so long as they are mounted in a way that allows hands-free viewing and voice operation. If information needs to be entered into the device by hand, the driver must come to a complete stop before doing so.
