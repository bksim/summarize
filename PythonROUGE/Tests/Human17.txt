Nicholas Joy, a 17-year-old skier, was found alive and well Tuesday morning at Maine's Sugarloaf ski resort after he was reported missing 2 days ago. Joy went missing after he and his father took separate ski trails from the top and Joy failed to show up at the bottom. Joy survived 2 nights in the wild by building a snow cave for shelter while walking toward the sound of snowmobiles during the day. A snowmobiler, who wasn't part of the search party, found Joy Tuesday morning on a trail off the western side of the mountain. Joy was taken to a hospital for evaluation.
