The parents of Roger Dunn, a 32-year-old man who was killed in an auto accident in April 2012, are suing Niagrara County officials for using their son's remains for police dog training. The Niagara County coroner, Russell Jackman, received Dunn's body.  The coroner provided a tissue sample from the body to volunteer firefighter chief Vincent Salerno, who was training a police dog to track human remains. Dunn's parents allege this was done without their knowledge or consent, and they found out through the media. Both the coroner and the firefighter have resigned and have been charged with misdemeanors. They were fined $1000 each and will have to complete community service hours with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. In addition, Jackman and Salerno were required to write letters of apology to Roger Dunn's parents. The Dunns have filed suit against the coroner's office, the volunteer firefighter department, and the individuals involved. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of compensation for emotional and physical damage.
