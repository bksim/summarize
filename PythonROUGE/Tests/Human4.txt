Mark Ciavarella Jr. was convicted of taking bribes from private prisons in exchange for handing down harsh sentences. The judge, known for his harsh courtroom manner, was sentenced to 28 years and ordered to pay $1.2m in restitution. Ciavarella Jr. and a second judge, Michael Conahan, were accused of taking more than $2m in bribes and extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars. Thousands of children, some as young as 10, were unjustly punished in the "kids for cash" conspiracy. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has overturned roughly 4,000 convictions.
