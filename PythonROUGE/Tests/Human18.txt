North Korea is vowing to cancel the 1953 Korean War cease-fire on March 11 if proposed sanctions go forward and US-South Korean military drills that began March 1 continue. North Korea's statement was made amid reports that the US and China approved a draft of UN Security Council sanctions that would punish North Korea for its third nuclear test on Feb. 12. The draft is expected to be circulated among UN Security Council members this week. North Korea said the US and others are going beyond economic sanctions and expanding into blunt aggression and military acts. North Korea also threatened to block a communications line between it and the US at the border village separating North and South Korea.
