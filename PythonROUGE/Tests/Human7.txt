Google Glass which allows users to take pictures on command will not be welcome in strip clubs. Since Google Glass has a recording device, strip club managers are banning the devices. Security officials have been asking people to check-in the headgear when they arrive. Smartphones are already banned from strip clubs to prevent customers from taking secret photos or "creepshots".
