According to MetroHealth, Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight have been released from the hospital. Cleveland Police confirm that the three women were located in a house on Seymour Avenue Monday afternoon. All three appeared to be in good health. Three brothers connected to the disappearances of Berry, DeJesus and Knight have been arrested. The men, ages 50, 52, and 54, are expected to be charged within the next 36 hours. "I can't wait to talk to her, I can't wait to hold her, to see her," said Gale Mitchell, Amanda's aunt. According to police a woman claiming to be Amanda Berry called 911 Monday. She said she was kidnapped 10 years ago and said she is currently at a home at 2210 Seymour. She also told the dispatcher that Gina DeJesus was with her. A third missing woman, 32-year old Michelle Knight, was in the home with Berry and DeJesus. It's believed Knight disappeared in 2002. One witness says he saw Amanda Berry come running out of the house kicking and screaming "Help me!" She was carrying a baby in her arms. Amanda was one day shy of her 17th birthday when she went missing on her way home to her birthday party. She disappeared on April 21, 2003 after leaving her job at Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue. Amanda's mother, Louwana, died at age 43 in March of 2006 after years of searching for her daughter. Many say Louwana died of a broken heart. In July 2012, the FBI received a tip that Amanda's body was buried in an area at West 30th between Wade and Seymour -- right around the corner from where they were found Monday. A backhoe was used to dig about six feet down, searching for anything that could be linked to Amanda. Reporter Ed Gallek learned prison inmate Robert Wolford, who was convicted of murdering a homeless man, wrote letters to law enforcement telling them he knows where Amanda's body is. Wolford was driven up from Lucasville and showed officers where they could find Amanda's body. He passed a polygraph during the investigation before the search for Amanda's remains began. Of course, officials didn't find anything, but were glad they checked the tip out. Cleveland Police arrested 52-year-old Ariel Castro at the house where the three women were found Monday. He is a Cleveland City Schools bus driver. Gale Mitchell said she never gave up hope and that she felt Amanda was alive. "You never give up. You just pray and pray and pray," said Gale. "It's crazy. I always knew that Amanda was a strong-willed person and eventually I knew she would get out of there. I just knew it. I just wondered 'Why not sooner?'" Nancy Ruiz, Gina DeJesus' mom told 19 Action News reporter Lydia Esparra that they are going to take a least 24 hours to connect with their daughter. After that they will talk to the media Tuesday. Gina DeJesus disappeared in 2004 at the age of 14. She was walking home from school when she vanished. At the time of her disappearance family members believed she was taken by human traffickers.
