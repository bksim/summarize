At a shareholders meeting, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz defended the company's pro-gay marriage stance after shareholder Tom Strobhar attempted to make the point that Starbucks' sales and earnings took a hit due to a boycott from opponents of gay marriage. Schultz went on to say to Strobhar that Starbucks provided shareholders with a 38% return over the last year despite the boycott and that Strobhar can sell his shares and go buy stocks in another company if he didn't like the company's stance. Many in the audience cheered after Schultz's comment.
