A stabbing incident at a northwest Harris County college on Tuesday injured 14 people, with two of them in critical condition, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said a 911 call was received at its call center at 11:12 a.m. regarding a stabbing at Lone Star College, 9191 Barker Cypress Road. "The call was described as a white male, on the loose, stabbing people," said Garcia.
College officials said the incident happened in and around the LSC-CyFair Health Science Center.
Garcia said the suspect was described as a white male, wearing a black hat, and black and white shirt.
"What we know at this point is that 14 people were injured. Two of them refused treatment," said Garcia at a 2:15 p.m. press conference on the school's campus.
An update from the Lone Star College system at 3 p.m. confirmed that six victims were taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital and six to North Cypress Medical Center. Four of the victims were airlifted and eight transported via ambulance, according to the update.
Garcia confirmed that two of the victims were in critical condition and four were in fair condition. Garcia would not confirm earlier reports that many of the victims were stabbed in their cheeks, shoulders and/or necks.
"This is a current and ongoing investigation," he told media at the press conference.
"I thought he was poking me and then I felt this sharp pain," said victim Xiomy, who was studying when she was attacked. "Then I realized he was actually stabbing me with something. I immediately pushed him away and he just walked off like nothing. I've never seen him before."
College officials have not said if the victims were students, staff or both. Deputies said the victims appeared to be randomly targeted.
Garcia said a 21-year-old suspect, a student currently enrolled at the college, was taken into custody. Deputies previously said they were searching for a second suspect, but investigators said they believe a single suspect was running from building to building.
Lone Star College System surveillance video and eyewitness accounts confirmed that there was only one suspect in the incident, according to officials at the college.
Investigators said a student tackled the suspect and that helped them capture the man. Garcia, however, would not comment on the details of the possibility of a student subduing the suspect.
The type of weapon used in the stabbing has not been released.
The college's business office said the Cy-Fair campus was locked down and then evacuated. Cars were being searched as people left the campus. School officials said that Lone Star College would be closed for the remainder of the day Tuesday, but would resume normal operations on Wednesday.
Four nearby Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District campuses were "secured" but not locked down. Those campuses were Birkes, Fiest, Jowell, Holmsey, Postma and Rennell elementary schools and Aragon Middle School.
