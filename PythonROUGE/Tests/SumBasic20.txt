Manning also pleaded not guilty to 12 counts which relate to the major offences of which he is accused by the US government. With Manning having pleaded not guilty to these overarching charges, the prosecution is now almost certain to press ahead to a full court-martial which is currently set for 3 June. The judge has indicated that the trial could run for 12 weeks, although Manning's guilty plea to the lesser charges may short-circuit the process as the government will no longer have to prove that he acquired and communicated the trove of classified material to WikiLeaks. Lind made clear that she will reserve her judgment on whether or not to accept Manning's guilty pleas until a later date.
