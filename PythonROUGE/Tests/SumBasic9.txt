Once again, Business Insider founder Henry Blodget is getting a boost from Amazon. Blodget told staffers in an internal memo that Bezos' individual investment is a "significant" portion of the total. Bezos' vote of confidence in Business Insider comes 15 years after Blodget, a stock analyst at the time, made a bold call on Amazon. Blodget reinvented himself as a publisher, launching Business Insider's first iteration in 2007. Bezos and Blodget discussed a potential investment over dinner in 2012, and Blodget said Bezos "sees some parallels" between Amazon and Business Insider. In turn, Blodget wants Business Insider to mirror Amazon's "obsession with customers and long-term focus.
