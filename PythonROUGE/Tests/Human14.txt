Police in Oklahoma arrested Misty VanHorn, 22, after she tried to sell her 2-year-old and 10-month-old to a woman in Arkansas through Facebook. Vanhorn tried to sell her 2-year-old for $1,000 or both children for $4,000. She wanted the money to pay for her boyfriend's $1,000 bail to get out of jail. Police say Vanhorn faces charges of trafficking minor children and is being held on a $40,000 bond. The state took custody of the children.
