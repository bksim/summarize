Detailed within a recent ruling by a California court in Fresno, a judge ruled that the law banning wireless, cellular phone use while operating a motor vehicle also applies to California residents and visitors that attempt to use a mapping application like Google Maps while driving. While section 23123 of the California Vehicle Code was instituted primarily to ban voice calling and typing out text messages while driving a car, a man named Steven Spriggs challenged a citation for violating section 23123 during a traffic stop during January 2012. Specifically, section 21123 states “a person shall not drive a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone unless that telephone is specifically designed and configured to allow hands-free listening and talking, and is used in that manner while driving.”
The defendant basically attempted to argue that the section only applied to voice calls.
