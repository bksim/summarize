In Italy, a court sentenced former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 76, to one year in prison for publishing an illegally obtained wiretap of a confidential phone call of a political rival in 2005. The conversation transcript was published in a newspaper run by Berlusconi's brother, who was also convicted on the same charge and sentenced to 2 years and 3 months in prison. Berlusconi can appeal the decision, and a jail term won't start until all possible appeals are exhausted. Meanwhile, Berlusconi is currently appealing his conviction last year on tax fraud charges and is still on trial over allegations he paid for sex with an underage prostitute. The latest verdict came after recent parliamentary elections in which Berlusconi's center-right coalition unexpectedly finished second among voters but saw no clear winner for a party to form a new government. Talks on forming a new government are expected to begin March 20 and the conviction has no bearing on Berlusconi's eligibility to participate.
