Business Insider has received $5 million of funding from an investment group lead by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  Business Insider's founder, Henry Blodget, is known to some for his 1998 call that Amazon's stock price would almost double to over $400, as well as his disappearance from the stock analysis world 5 years later after being charged with securities fraud. Blodget stated that Bezos sees some similarities between Amazon and Business Insider. According to Blodget, the $5 million is tentatively marked for investment in various areas including editorial, sales and marketing, tech/product, subscriptions and events in addition to office expansion.
