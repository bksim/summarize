VanHorn, 22, was arrested Saturday for alleged trafficking of minors on Facebook â€” offering her 10-month old and her 2 year-old for $4,000. VanHorn was dealing with a woman in Fort Smith, Ark., according to The Oklahoman. Which would mean she'll be lucky if she isn't charged with a federal crime: Fort Smith is just across the state line from VanHorn's home in Sallisaw, Ok.
"Just come to Sallisaw, it's only 30 minutes away and I'll give you all of her stuff and let y'all have her forever for $1,000," read VanHorn's Facebook message to the Fort Smith woman, as unearthed in the police report by the Daily Dot. Ironically, police believe VanHorn wanted the $1,000 to bail her boyfriend out of jail.
