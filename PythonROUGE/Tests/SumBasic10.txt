Beginning today, Disney will continue to license out the LucasArts properties (namely Star Wars), but has ceased the development of all internal projects. A part of my childhood — a part of an entire generation of gamer’s collective childhood, really — goes down with LucasArts. Thank you for Maniac Mansion and Day Of The Tentacle, two games which helped to prove that video games could be funny, and somehow remain funny to this very day. Thank you for Grim Fandango and Full Throttle.
